## P-Kin.com

For my very first VueJS project I choose to create a new portfolio website for myself. My goal was to make it easy for anyone who is interested in my work to find all the relevant information.

### Features:

- **About me & my skills -** On the home page there are a few words about me and I list all the technologies and languages I'm familiar with

- **Portfolio -** All my recent, noteworthy projects can be found here, with links to their repositories.

- **Pens -** Some of my works on CodePen, especially animations.

### Technologies used:
- Vue
- TypeScript
- Vuex
- SCSS
- Firebase REST APIs

### Methods I used:
- **Central state management -**
My first experiment with Vue and it's state management, all data and UI state are managed in different modules of a central VueX store.

- **Routing and lazy loading -**
Portfolio page and some assets use lazy loading for better performance.

- **Dynamic data -**
Whether I want to add a new portfolio item or make a change on my tech stack, no need to touch the frontend, only to adjust the data in the database.
